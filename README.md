## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8]
- [Gradle 4.5.1](https://gradle.org)

## Running the application locally

Run the application locally using the Gradle wrapper (gradlew)

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Deploying the application to OpenShift

The easiest way to deploy the sample application to OpenShift is to use the [OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/index.html):

```shell
oc new-app <TBD>
```

This will create:

* An ImageStream called "springboot-maven3-centos"
* An ImageStream called "springboot-sample-app"
* A BuildConfig called "springboot-sample-app"
* DeploymentConfig called "springboot-sample-app"
* Service called "springboot-sample-app"

If you want to access the app from outside your OpenShift installation, you have to expose the springboot-sample-app service:

```shell
oc expose springboot-sample-app --hostname=www.example.com
```
